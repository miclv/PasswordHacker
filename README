Execution: python3 hack.py [host] [port]

This program is a password hacker that was completed over the course of
https://hyperskill.org/projects/80?track=2.

The "password hacker" program sends a JSON object containing a login and password to the server.
First, the program tests logins from logins.txt until the error returned is the one for an incomplete password.
Once the login is found the program will then check for the first character of the password a -> Z, 0 -> 9.
Based on the situation given to us, to see if the character added is correct we check the difference in time between
when the message was sent and received.
